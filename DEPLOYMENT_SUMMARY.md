4. **Data Storage**: All user data stays local (browser storage)

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

**Site shows 404**:
- Ensure repository is public
- Check deployment workflow succeeded
- Wait 5-10 minutes and try again

**Blank page or missing assets**:
- Base path is correctly set (already done ✅)
- Try hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

**Deployment fails**:
- Check logs: https://github.com/theback-space/spine-education-inte/actions
- Verify `npm run build` works locally
- Re-run the workflow
